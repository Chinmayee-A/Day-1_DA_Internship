# Day-1_DA_Internship
Today's Task is Data cleaning and Processing.
For this task, I was given a choice to choose between Python (pandas) and Excel. I've choosen to work with Excel's Power Query Editor. 
I chose Netflix_title data from kaggle and downloaded the CSV file titled netflix_title
To go to the Power query editor, it is important to import the file and click on transform button. 
Ive brainstormed different ways to do the data analysis and finalised on the attched file. I
The main concept I have learned today was Conditional Columns in Power Query. I did not know they existed. I have watched couple of videos and artcles to educate myself and experimented with the dataset.
Main issues i have encountered in the dataset are Missing values, and text spill over(This part took majority of time as i was unable to understand what went wrong. I tried loading data multiple times only to realise that the original file had text split as in there was enter after half part of the text. This lead to text spill  over and eventual missing columns).
How did i tackle missing info?
I have understood various methods to deal with missing info. One can delete the cells, fill the cells with something else.
I have also understood that its a industry practise to not delete any data and simply write missing/unknown or something similar to this as it helps the organisation to decode what went wrong in the source data file.
Also, my favorite thing today is mentioning the (a) in some cells. As in i instead of writing missing, gave the mode which in my case was USA. I've added (a) to indicate that this was just an assumption. This excersise made me comfortable with excel's Power Query
Lastly, I attempted to learn python today. I am familiar with basic python only. As an Accounting and Finance student, most of my learnings through college was in Excel. I, myself took the initiation to learn basic python. Today with the knowledge i have, i have attempted to learn pandas and I have shared my progress. I am still not comfortable with Python and its libraries yet but i am attempting to do the task everyday so that i can improve my knowledge on the same.
